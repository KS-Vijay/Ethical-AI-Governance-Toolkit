# Ethical AI Governance Toolkit

**Audit your AI models. Detect bias. Prevent misuse. Build trust.**

The **Ethical AI Governance Toolkit** is an project that helps organizations audit their AI datasets and models for ethical compliance. It provides tools to detect bias, generate dataset fingerprints for verification, flag unauthorized or illegal training data, and protect user-uploaded data from misuse.

## Why This Matters

AI systems are increasingly used in critical sectors — healthcare, finance, hiring, education — but hidden risks like biased training data, lack of transparency, copyright violations, or misuse of user data can cause real harm. There is currently no simple way for developers, companies, or the public to verify how ethically an AI system was trained or deployed.

This toolkit empowers teams to build AI more responsibly, while giving regulators, clients, and users greater transparency and trust.

## Key Features

- **Bias Detection** — Evaluate datasets for bias across demographics and sensitive attributes.
- **Dataset Fingerprinting** — Verify whether validated data is actually used in deployed models.
- **Copyright & Data Usage Auditing** — Detect unauthorized or copyrighted data in model training.
- **User Data Protection** — Prevent misuse of user-uploaded data for future model training.
- **Transparent Reporting** — Generate ethical audit reports to share with stakeholders.

## Who It’s For

- AI/ML Developers  
- Data Scientists  
- Startups building AI products  
- Large enterprises deploying AI  
- AI ethics researchers  
- Regulators and auditors  

## Impact

This toolkit aims to raise the standard for ethical AI development by offering practical tools to detect risks and promote accountability. In doing so, it helps build public trust in AI — which is critical for its responsible adoption.
